# DRL-Active-Object-Detection
Deep Reinforcement Learning for Active Object Detection: A novel approach that combines deep reinforcement learning with active learning strategies to improve object detection performance while minimizing annotation costs.

## Key Features
- Utilizes a deep learning-based object detection architecture, such as Faster R-CNN.
- Incorporates a deep reinforcement learning agent to actively select informative and diverse samples for annotation.
- Employs active learning strategies, such as uncertainty estimation and curriculum learning, to improve training efficiency and detection performance.
- Provides a modular and flexible implementation for easy experimentation with different components and techniques.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/DRL-ActiveObjectDetection.git
cd DRL-ActiveObjectDetection
```

2. Install the required dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Download and preprocess the COCO dataset (or any other desired dataset) and place it in the `datasets/` directory.
2. Configure the object detection architecture, training parameters, and reinforcement learning agent settings in the `config/` directory.
3. Train and evaluate the proposed model:
```
python main.py
```
